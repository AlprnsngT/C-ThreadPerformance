# Multithreading Performance Comparison in C#

This repository contains a C# project that explores the performance of multithreading and parallel computations using different approaches. The project includes tests and comparisons of standard sequential calculations, multithreaded calculations, and parallel computations.

## Project Overview

In this project, we analyze the performance of various computation methods using C#. We focus on the following key aspects:

- Standard sequential computation
- Multithreaded computation using the `Thread` class
- Parallel computations using C#'s built-in parallel library

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred C# development environment.
3. Build and run the project to execute the performance tests.

## Features

- Multithreading examples to demonstrate concurrent execution.
- Parallel computations to explore the benefits of utilizing multiple cores.
- Performance tests with timing measurements to compare different approaches.
- Code examples showcasing the implementation of various computation methods.

## Results

The project provides insights into the performance characteristics of different computation methods. It compares the execution times of standard sequential calculations, multithreaded calculations, and parallel computations.
